  CVE-2022-29917:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, Tom Ritter and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 99 and Firefox ESR 91.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
